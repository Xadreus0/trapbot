# Privacy Policy for TrapBot

TrapBot is a Discord moderation bot designed to assist server administrators with automated onboarding enforcement and bot detection. We respect user privacy and aim to collect and retain only the minimum information required for the bot to function.

## Information Collected

TrapBot may process or temporarily store the following information within servers where it is installed:

- **Server ID**  
  Used to identify which server configuration applies when the bot is operating.

- **User ID**  
  Used to track users who are temporarily pending onboarding verification or enforcement.

- **Role IDs**  
  Used to determine whether a user has been assigned the configured default role, trap role, or moderator-exempt roles.

- **Timestamps**  
  Used to measure elapsed time between onboarding events and enforcement actions.

TrapBot does **not** read message content, private messages, or user profile information beyond what is provided through Discord’s server member events.

## Use of Information

The information processed by TrapBot is used solely for the following purposes:

- To determine whether users have completed onboarding correctly
- To apply role-based enforcement actions as configured by server administrators
- To provide operational logs and status information to server moderators and administrators
- To support delayed enforcement that allows legitimate users time to correct onboarding mistakes

TrapBot does not use collected data for advertising, tracking, or profiling purposes.

## Data Retention

User-related information is stored only as long as necessary to complete onboarding enforcement. Once a user is cleared, enforced, or removed, their pending data is discarded.

Server configuration data is retained until the bot is removed from the server or reset by an administrator.

## Data Sharing

TrapBot does not sell, share, or disclose collected information to third parties. Information is only accessed by the bot itself and only for operational purposes, except where required by law.

## Security

Reasonable technical measures are taken to protect stored data from unauthorized access. Sensitive credentials such as bot tokens are not shared publicly.

## Forks and Third-Party Deployments

TrapBot is an open-source project. This Privacy Policy applies only to the official deployment of TrapBot as maintained by the original author.

If this software is forked, modified, or deployed independently by third parties, those deployments are not controlled by the original author, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them. Third-party operators are solely responsible for their own data handling practices.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of TrapBot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact

For questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the bot maintainer via the designated support or repository contact channel.
